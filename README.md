# fun_with_template_parameter_packs
Example code of how to correctly use template parameter packs in C++14
# Evil C++ syntax
This is probably one of the most confusing examples of syntax you'll see anywhere.
# Fun for experts
Beginners shouldn't be taught about perfect forwarding of template parameter packs (std::forward<>...)
# Not C
No respectable C compiler is known to compile this evil C++14 code.
\
C-style "variadic functions" are simple to use,
\
but this evil C++ syntax is faster, and more type-safe than the "va_arg" alternative.
\
C++ wins, but at what cost...ðŸ˜œ
